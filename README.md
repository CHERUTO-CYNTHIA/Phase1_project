Safety is critical in the competitive, highly regulated aviation sector and must remain at the top of any airline's list if it wants to remain profitable long term. The biggest strategic imperative for the company as it moves into this space is identifying aircraft models that are low-risk. This analysis sheds light on what are the factors that lead to number of accidents, whether it is age or state-wise distribution and provides a data teamled research approach as answers in order to help make informed and sustainable aircraft acquisition decisions

##  Overview

The goal of this project will be to determine which aircraft would be the safest for Public Transportation Company's new aviation division. The project furthers the inquiry by studying aircraft models that are 'lower rate of accidents', a general relationship between age of aircraft to safety and testing into ride geography factors that influence accident rates, to help inform potentially modifiable characteristics for airplane acquisition. This in turn allows the company to choose the aircraft with less risk and more profit potential.

### Business Problem

The company is investing in the aviation industry of the new era, under a strategy to diversify investments and reduce risks through other opportunities that are less exposed to market volatility and provide more stable returns. However as they may not be aware of all the possible aviation hazards out there, this is a study that will really make a difference in matching and informing which low-risk aircraft to buy. This way the company can cut business costs, assure operational safety, and create purpose-driven decisions.

## Questions to help with the analysis
1. What aircraft models are notorious for causing the most accidents?
2. Where do the majority of these accidents occur?
3. How does the severity of injuries vary based on the aircraft model?
4. How does the aircraft model and category affect the extent of damage?
5. Which aircraft models are prone to accidents based on their manufacturing location?
6. What is the optimal engine type for aircraft safety?
7. Which aircraft models are involved in the most accidents, depending on their purpose of flight?
8. Is there a correlation between weather conditions and accident rates, as well as between weather and location?
9. At what stages of flight do most accidents happen?
10. Are there specific factors, such as weather or aircraft type, that contribute to accidents in particular flight phases?
Dive into these intriguing questions and uncover the insights that can enhance aviation safety!

# Data Understanding and Analysis
Data Source and Description

Covering civil aircraft accidents from 1962 to 2023 through covered domestic and international incidents, data was provided by the National Transportation Safety Board. Datasetsâž¾Chosen dataset-AviationData. The offers excellent lists of aircraft models, incident types, locations and safety record saved as csv. In this study, data cleaning and analysis techniques were used to 1) understand what we know about low-risk aircrafts; and 2) examine factors that affect accident rates for these aircrafts, such as handling missing data or detecting outliers.

## Summary
Among other things, the analysis indicates that it is imperative to identify those aircraft models which are low-risk so as to minimize costs and achieve operational safety. The main conclusions are:
Age of Aircraft and Risk: Incidents are more frequent in older aircraft thus newer ones presenting lower risk.

Geographical Effects on Incident Frequence: The frequency of occurances of accidents differs by country and this is a real indicator that should take into account the geographical features influent in analysing risk in an aircraft.

Low-Risk Aircraft Models:Based on continuous trend analysis, some models consistently revealed less incidents, thus slelecting these models is your better choice!
